This is a library to use
[Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)
with Angular.

## Install

If you do not have [@ng-web-apis/common](https://github.com/ng-web-apis/common):

```
npm i @ng-web-apis/common
```

Now install the package:

```
npm i @ng-web-apis/speech
```

## How to use

Web Speech API consists of speech synthesis and speech recognition.

1. Use `SpeechSynthesisModule` to gain access to `TextToSpeechDirective` and `UtterancePipe`.
   Use them like the example below for speech synthesis functionality:

```html
<textarea
    class="textarea"
    [(ngModel)]="text"
    [waTextToSpeech]="text | waUtterance: options"
    [waTextToSpeechPaused]="paused"
    (waTextToSpeechEnd)="onEnd()"
/>
```

2. For speech recognition use `SpeechRecognitionService` in supporting browsers (only Chrome at this point)

## Operators

`SpeechRecognitionService` provides access to speech recognition in familiar RxJS Observable model.
To work with the stream there are certain operators included in this library:

1. `confidenceAbove` to filter recognitions to desired level of confidence
2. `continuous` to enable continuous mode of recognition
3. `final` to only include final recognition results
4. `firstAlternative` to quickly retrieve first alternative (which typically is the only one anyway)
5. `skipUntilSaid` to ignore stream until certain phrase is said
6. `takeUntilSaid` to stop listening to stream upon certain phrase
7. `isSaid` utility function to check if a phrase is in `SpeechRecognitionResult[]`

You may want to use `repeat()` and `retry()` in your stream to restart speech recognition.
It is stopped after some time and error is thrown if nothing was said for a while.

Here are a few examples:

```ts
// Record speech after "Okay Angular" is said
this.stream$ = this.speechRecognition$.pipe(
    retry(),
    repeat(),
    skipUntilSaid('Okay Angular'),
    takeUntilSaid('Thank you Angular'),
    repeat(),
    final(),
    continuous(),
);
```

```ts
// Fire photon torpedoes with a voice command
this.torpedoes$ = this.speechRecognition$.pipe(
    retry(),
    repeat(),
    filter(isSaid('Fire photon torpedoes')),
);
```

## Tokens

There are also a couple of tokens included in this library:

1. `SPEECH_RECOGNITION_MAX_ALTERNATIVES` to configure number of alternatives presented in `SpeechRecognitionResult`
2. `SPEECH_RECOGNITION_SUPPORT` to check if browser supports speech recognition
3. `SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_SUPPORT` to check if browser supports speech synthesis
4. `SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_VOICES` to get the list of available voices for speech synthesis
